# CallACabClone
A sample app in android using Kotlin to call a cab using your phone.

This is my first android app that I built, to learn android app development using Kotlin and Android Studio.
I do not aim to push this to the app store as it is a tutorial to learn the pipeline of android apps.

Some of the features I implemented are RecyclerView, Data Binding in Kotlin, Parse Connectivity using AWS
